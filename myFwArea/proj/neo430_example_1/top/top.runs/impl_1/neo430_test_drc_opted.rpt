REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 neo430_top_test_inst/neo430_boot_rom_inst_true.neo430_boot_rom_inst/rdata_reg has an input control pin neo430_top_test_inst/neo430_boot_rom_inst_true.neo430_boot_rom_inst/rdata_reg/ADDRARDADDR[11] (net: neo430_top_test_inst/neo430_boot_rom_inst_true.neo430_boot_rom_inst/addr_i[8]) which is driven by a register (neo430_top_test_inst/neo430_cpu_inst/neo430_reg_file_inst/sreg_reg[8]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
